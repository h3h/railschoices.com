<h1>The Why, How and Who of Rails Choices</h1>

<p>
  This site was formed out of a recurring desire to know what my options were
  when creating a new Rails app. I never knew quite where new plugins or
  libraries fit in the grand scheme of building a Rails app, or how they
  compared with existing solutions.
  <a href="/application/file-upload-management.html">Should I use
  atttachment_fu or Paperclip?</a> Do they even provide the same functionality?
  Hopefully this site will supply the ongoing answers to such questions.
</p>

<p>
  The site is written in YAML and HTML, using the HTML5 doctype with HTML4
  elements. The <a href="http://github.com/h3h/railschoices.com">source</a> is
  stored on GitHub and the files are generated with
  <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> on
  <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, which hosts
  the site by way of a DNS pointer from
  <a href="http://mediatemple.net/">MediaTemple</a>. The color scheme was
  inspired by the
  <a href="http://www.colourlovers.com/palette/482416/Wasabi_Suicide">Wasabi
  Suicide</a> palette on
  <a href="http://www.colourlovers.com/">COLOURlovers</a>. Primary page headers
  are rendered with the open-source
  <a href="http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/fonts/4-chunk">Chunk font</a>
  from <a href="http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/">The League of Movable
  Type</a>, in those browsers that support <code>@font-face</code>.
</p>

<p>
  This site was conceived, planned and created by
  <a href="http://h3h.net/">Brad Fults</a>, a web developer in San Francisco,
  California.
